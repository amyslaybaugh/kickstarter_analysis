# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
An analysis of Kickstarter campaign funding of theater projects, in relation to launch dates and funding goals.

### Purpose
To discover if there is a correlation between campaign outcomes and launch date as well as to analyze the relationship between the dollar value of the goal and the outcome of the campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
May, June and July are the best months to start a campaign for a successful outcome and December is the least successful month.
Failed campaigns were fairly even regardless of month started, although there is a slight uptick in the summer months and October.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Campaigns with a goal under $5000 are the most successful.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
A limitation of this dataset is that it does not break down the genre of the plays.
Additional graphs of the data sorted by region might prove insightful.
